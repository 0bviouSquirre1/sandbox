figure out time

we have a heat-source, a container to put the water and leaf in, and tea comes out in the end

command structure:
    checks
    encapsulated method?
    reports


My suggestion would be to step through it with pdb and see what's going on
You can drop this incantation into your code to invoke an evennia-aware breakpoint: from evennia import set_trace; set_trace()

put leaf in kettle
get kettle from hearth
fill cup from kettle -> doesn't transfer liquid
